# Claude Code - Global Configuration

## Language
- Code, variables, commits: always in English
- Explanations and conversation: Spanish (direct style)

## Response Style
- Be concise. Don't explain the obvious.
- If something is important, mention why in one line.
- No emojis or motivational phrases.
- Get to the point.

## Preferred Tools
Use modern tools:
- `bat` instead of `cat`
- `rg` instead of `grep`
- `fd` instead of `find`
- `eza` instead of `ls`
- Editor: `nvim`

## Code Rules
- Never use `any` in TypeScript - use `unknown` or generics
- Descriptive names for functions and variables
- Don't add obvious comments
